Kruskal's algorithm is used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, weighted graph.
It collects all the edges from the adjMatrix and sorts them in acending order, skipping those that create cycles.
Initializes Union-Find structure
and process the edges in sorted order

Built of an Edge class with src, dest, and weight
a Graph class to store edges and vertices
a Union-Find (disjoint set) structure
and Kruskals algorithm.
